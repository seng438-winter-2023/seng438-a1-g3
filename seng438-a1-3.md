# Introduction
Throughout this lab, our group conducted a multitude of tests on the provided ATM simulation. These tests include exploratory testing, manual scripted testing, and regression testing. Exploratory testing consists of devising a high-level plan to conduct tests in accordance to. Then, the tester will proceed with using the system with the devised approach, keeping track of successful features as well as defects within the system. Manual scripted testing involves a pre-determined set of use cases which gets tested by a tester one-by-one. Finally, regression testing is conducted once an update has occured on the system. Regression testing features specific testing on bugs discovered through the previous phases of testing to ensure that they have been fixed, as well as discovering news bugs which may be caused by updates to the system.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Team A:
    We used a breadth-first testing approach for our exploratory testing plan. The general idea was to try and cover as many of
the major functions as we could without going into too much detail for a specific one. The main purpose of this testing method was to get acclimated with the major functionality of the ATM application while trying to get a general idea of the bugs present. 

Team B: 
    For our plan, we decided to go down a slightly different route, and mainly test any visual bugs, as well as error checking. 
We will take on this approach by focussing on purposefully entering incorrect inputs as arguments, and seeing how the program handles that. We will also report any visual bugs such as misspelling or incorrect names of buttons/labels. 


# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing
Stark differences can be observed between exploratory testing and manual functional testing. Manual functional testing observes a systems core use cases and provides test cases to evaluate if these use cases work as intended. These tests are well defined and specific, providing a clear approach to how testers can conduct the tests and observe the results. Exploratory tests follow a high-level testing plan which provides testers guidance on how to complete the tests. These tests are not pre-defined like manual functional testing and are completed as testers discover bugs within the system. Exploratory testing is free use of the system while following a loose guideline, while manual functional testing is a well-defined set of tests which observes bugs within the systems use cases. 

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports
The two streams of exploratory testing were both valued as successful and important to the testing process. With the chosen streams, both subgroups were able to cover tests which the other group would not be able to within the scope of their plan. While plan B was not as successful as plan A in finding bugs within the program, it covered cases where we expected bugs to exist, which is always worth checking. Plan A was able to cover many fundamentals of the systems requirements and overlapped with bugs found in the manual scripted testing segment. 

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 
The pair testing was done by dividing the four-person group in to two subteams of two testers. Aaron and Avi used the methodology for exploratory test plan A which focused on a breadth-first approach to the exploratory tests. Jesse and Ethan used the plan for Team B which focused on where we expected bugs to exist in the program. While plan A found more bugs, both teams spent equal time and effort in the exploratory testing period. As a group, the manual scripted tests were completed with one member running the tests on the program, one number listing off the given test cases, one member recording test results, and the final member formatting the results in to bug reports. Overall, the entire team divided the work evenly and put in effort for their specific roles. 


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned


# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself
    The main comments/feedback our team had in mind was regarding the instructions and some of the bug reports given. We had 
quite a bit of trouble understanding some of the instructions given as many steps were quite vague. On the note of vagueness, many of the test cases were quite difficult to understand, for example Test Cases 3, 39, and 40. The steps to reproduce did not make much sense to us, as well the sections that mentioned establishing a connection with the bank.
