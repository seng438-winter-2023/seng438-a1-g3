# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Team A:

    We used a breadth-first testing approach for our exploratory testing plan. The general idea was to try and cover as many of
the major functions as we could without going into too much detail for a specific one. The main purpose of this testing method was to get acclimated with the major functionality of the ATM application while trying to get a general idea of the bugs present. 

Team B: 
    For our plan, we decided to go down a slightly different route, and mainly test any visual bugs, as well as error checking. 
We will take on this approach by focussing on purposefully entering incorrect inputs as arguments, and seeing how the program handles that. We will also report any visual bugs such as misspelling or incorrect names of buttons/labels.
